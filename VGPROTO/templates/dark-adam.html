<h1>Dark Adam</h1>
<p>
	This was made as a project for my C++ class and also doubles as a sort of demo/trailer
	for the full version I intend to make. It was made in 3 weeks with 
	<a href="http://triosdevelopers.com/~S.Holmes/">Stewart Holmes</a> 
	and was an interesting project, as we realized what we wanted to do was not so simple.
	We ended up needing to make an event system to manage all the actions, which was not
	planned. This ended up cutting into alot of the time and we had to scale back some
	features. The setting is a dystopian city, where any form of weapons are banned, 
	and gangs completely run the city.
</p>
<p>
	The main focus of the story is on a character Adam, who left town after a big
	disaster where he faked his own death.  He's back in town now to find out
	the truth of what happened that night.  Along the way he meets with his old gang
	and deal with the old gangs and the new ones.
</p>
<p>
	The design is that of a JRPG made with text adventure elements.  The city is 
	made of 'Areas' which have 'Rooms' to explore.  Events run everything that 
	happens, combat events start off the hop, and everything else can be seen 
	from the events menu.  During conversations the text can scroll but as this
	can be annoying, and due to the lack of main menu, you can try it 
	<a href='DarkAdam/DarkAdam-scroll.zip'>with</a>
	or
	<a href='DarkAdam/DarkAdam-noScroll.zip'>without</a>
	scrolling.
